# Snake Game | Scrimba Challenge

## Overview
I remember playing snake game on my TI-83 Plus graphing calculator back in high school, so this was a fun project to work on! 

Following along with the lesson on Scrimba was a little confusing at first which is why I wrote a blog post walkthrough of the lesson. It helped nail down some of the concepts and I was better able to wrap my head around the *why* of the code.

## My Goals
The following is a close approximation of the code in the lesson with some minor tweaks on my part. The instructor, Ania Kubow, left us with a blank canvas and my goal with this project was to style it my own style.
